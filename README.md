# Saral-Python-Requests-API
I made this project Using Saral API in Terminal To Learn Any cource available.

SARAL is the eLearning platform of NavGurukul, which is available on website http://saral.navgurukul.org. I have created app where users can access the content of saral using the terminal.

Here I implemented a basic version of an Learning API, using request of PYTHON. The users can manage and create different courses, exercises and also manage submissions, using basic CRUD operations.

To install express, run the following command on your terminal in Linux.

    pip3 install requests

    import json,os,requests

To run your code, first open your server port using python.py in your working directory in terminal, And then you can apply the basic CRUD operations.
